### Vim config for rust development
Feel free to take advantage of this and mess with it as required.

Setup Instructions in bash folder readme

Might end up making this an install script

Note: The .vimrc file attached has to be moved to the active .vimrc file (I use :w ~/.vimrc but there is probably a better way.

For Ubuntu: The default theming is really ugly with a transparent vim background so if not pre-configured I recommend commenting the bottom line of the .vimrc file out  and setting the background to dark like this directly above the colorscheme set:

```bash
set background=dark 
```
